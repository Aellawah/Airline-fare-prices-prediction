Passengers want to check for flights fare prices in different airlines according to number of stops during their fights , so throught this dataset which consists of flights information of different airlines we will train our Machine learning model to predict prices for every flight based on specific features that we can reflect to users.

* After wrangling the data we have changed the data columns types to fit our analysis and removed null values records.
* we applied feature engineering on several columns to extract values from them and include them in our machine learning model such as dividing date columns into years months days and seperating categorical columns into seperate values that can be used idividually in our model, used label encoding for ordinal data and hot encoding for nominal data
* we fitted the data after transformation on Random Forest Regressor model which gave us a pretty good results.
